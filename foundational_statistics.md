# Foundational Statistical Concepts


**Mean.** For a discrete random variable X, the mean of observations
*x*<sub>1</sub>, ..., *x*<sub>*n*</sub> is:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\displaystyle\sum\_{i = 1}^n x_i
$$

**Expected Value.** For a continuous random variable X, the mean of the
variable over the range -$$ \< x \< $$ is

*x̄* = ∫<sub>−∞</sub><sup>∞</sup>*x**f*(*x*)*d**x*

The mean is also known as the **expected value** and denoted as *μ*.
